#   this config file at /opt/lark/rpyc.cfg
#   environment variables with these same keys
#   command line args when starting larkNames
# the priority for the parameters are in descending order
# i.e the parameters in the larkNames script are overwritten by values here,
# which will in turn be overwritten by environment variables,
# which will in turn be overwritten by command line parameters
